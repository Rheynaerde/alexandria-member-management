# Alexandria: Member management

This project is part of the larger Alexandria project in which we try to modernise the management
of our fencing club _Degencentrum Rheynaerde_. This specific project is concerned with automating
the member management.

This project is tailored to our personal needs, but I hope it is written general enough to be at
least of some use to other clubs.
